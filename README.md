   ```

5. **Configure the app**:

   Open `core/settings.py`:

   ```python
   # Add the following line
   AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.User"

   # Application definition
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
      # Add the app to INSTALLED_APPS
      "app",
      "app.books",
      "app.users",
      "drf_redesign",
      "rest_framework",
      # Default apps
      ...
   ]
   ```

   Open `core/urls.py`:

   ```python
   # Import `include`
   from django.urls import path, include
   
   
   urlpatterns = [
      # Include `app.urls`
      path("", include("app.urls")),
      ...
   ]
   ```

6. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
